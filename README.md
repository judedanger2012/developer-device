so this device is a open development device ment for developing small handheld devices.The pcb schematic was based on a hackpad and used some of the fundemental compnets that you
will find here https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide#pcb_design due to software diffrences the buttons and led lights are diffrent componets but are still compatiball with the device.
The reason i chose to make this device for blueprint was due to my intrest in proggramable handheld devices were your imagonation is the limit to what you can create.
my experiences and struggles while makeing the pcb are docummented in the journell file if your intrested in my experiences while makeing the pcb and later the case and code 
i highly reccomend takeng a look.

basic program will be provided as a circuit python file this willl be the first aplication made for this device.
the pcb schematics for this device were made in easyeda pictures and a guid will be provided later to help others replicate the device.

the componets include:
XIAO-RP2040-DIP (micro controller) x1
C273350 (toggle switches) x2
C118141 (buttons) x2
C9900023731 (led lights) x2
note: these componet numbers are used in the easyeda liabrary and are provided so you may copy this pcb using easyeda.

more coming soon!!!
