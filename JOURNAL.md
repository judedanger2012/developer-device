## 10/6/2025 - failed to create the device.  

i spent a while attempting to learn and route a display and some toggle switches to a pico but couldn't figure it out after more and more attempts i thought i had it until i attempted
 to convert to a pcb then i checked to see what difficulties or errors existed and well it was a lot so i restarted for a third time after like 3 hours of work.![1.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--24ce5875d4ca0bdb515ff5ebd98634814afc90db/1.jpg)
